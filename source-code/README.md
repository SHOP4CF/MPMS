## Purpose

MPMS provides end-to-end (i.e., from order reception until product delivery) manufacturing process management and orchestration of activities by:

- modeling processes and agents
- executing in automated way the processes by assigning activities to agents
- providing process monitoring for a complete status overview of the manufacturing processes
